Precedent - Whether it's hosting, being behind the analyst desk, or being a live commentator one will always have to deal with balancing the burden of knowledge. Precedent is an organization web application that seeks to equip live talent BEFORE they're in front of a camera.

Precent is a full-stack CRUD web application that allows users to see events happening in their area, register for said events, and allows users to view information about attendees. The user is also capable of editing their events and leaving personal notes for themselves on event pages to refer to at a later time. The app is designed for on air talent and event organizers to be able to able to view and take notes about event attendees in order to prepare themsleves for an event.

## Optimizations

In the future I'd like to add the ability for users to have their own profiles and leave user-side notes on attendee profiles. I would also like to add a way to filter events on the event feed. Potentially I would like to integrate use of the mediastream API as well for the potential for audio adn video notes ot be left on both user and event profiles.

## Lessons Learned:

Built upon my comfort with documents (objects) being stored in MongoDB and using CRUD in tandem with the database. Strengthened ability and comfort using Node and managing the backend, while familiarizing myself with ejs. Learned how to more efficiently manage routes when dealing with users with different permissions. Reinforced how to handle user log ins and authentication suing passport. Reinforced knowledge of loops. Learned how to use and apply Bootsrap 5 for styling. Reinforced the Separation of Concerns.
